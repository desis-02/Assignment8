# Assignment8
This project explores the use of Seaborn and Python to perform data visualization on both real-world and built-in datasets. The goal is to analyze and communicate insights through heatmaps, boxplots, and various relational, distributional, and categorical visualizations.
Part 1: Pulse Data
The dataset represents pulse measurements of individuals following different diets and exercises. We used:
- A heatmap to show average 30-minute pulse by diet and exercise.
- Boxplots to examine pulse variability based on diet and type of exercise.

Part 2: Planets Dataset
We created six visualizations:
- Relational: Time trends and orbital periods by distance.
- Distributional: Mass distribution and boxplot of mass by method.
- Categorical: Frequency of discovery methods and average orbital period by method.

Limitations:
Some datasets had missing values that were implicitly handled by Seaborn or excluded during plotting. Additionally, outliers in the planets dataset skewed certain visualizations.
